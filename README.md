# Letterboxd Stats

A web-app to get pretty charts that show your taste in films! The app uses public data from your Letterboxd profile and creates visuals that can usually be seen only by the Letterboxd Pro users!

Developed using Python, Plotly and Streamlit.

**Note: the code is still pretty messy (to be fixed soon).**
# Setup
